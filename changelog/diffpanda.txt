Key Features

### Core Comparison Engine

* **Line and Word-level Diffing**: The tool compares texts line by line. For lines that have changed, it performs a detailed word-level comparison to precisely highlight added, deleted, and modified words.
* **Three-Panel View**: Results are shown in a clear three-column layout: the original text, the revised text, and a merged "comparison" view that shows all changes in context for easy review.
* **Color-Coded Results**: Added, removed, and unchanged lines are clearly distinguished by color, making it easy to spot differences at a glance.

### Smart File Support

* **Paste or Upload**: You can paste text directly into the comparison fields or upload files from your computer.
* **Specialized Parsers**: Diffpanda intelligently extracts the main text content from various file formats, ignoring metadata. It supports plain text (.txt), subtitles (.srt), gettext files (.po), and translation memories (.tmx).

### Reviewing & Reporting

* **Commenting System**: Activate a dedicated comments column in the results table to add notes and feedback directly alongside each change, perfect for collaborative reviews.
* **PDF & HTML Export**: Export a complete report of the differences. The exported document includes all changes, word-level highlights, and any comments you have added, formatted in a clean HTML or PDF file.

### User Experience

* **Multilingual Interface**: The tool is available in both English and Spanish.
* **Simple & Fast**: A clean, straightforward interface designed to help you compare texts and generate reports quickly, without unnecessary complexity.
