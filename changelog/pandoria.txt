Pandoria v1.1.1 - Code Import & Shortcuts

Release Date: November 25, 2025

This update focuses on workflow flexibility and speed, adding direct code handling and improved editor navigation.

New Features

Direct TMX Code Import: You can now import a TMX translation memory by simply pasting the raw XML code, removing the need to upload a physical file. The new "Import Code" modal includes real-time validation, displaying a green indicator for valid code or a red warning for errors before importing.

Keyboard Navigation Shortcuts: To speed up the editing process, you can now navigate between segments using your keyboard. Use Ctrl + Down Arrow to jump to the next segment and Ctrl + Up Arrow to return to the previous one.

Pandoria v1.1.0 - Auto-Backup
========================================

Release Date: November 7, 2025

This update introduces a crucial quality-of-life feature: automatic session backup.

New Features

Automatic Backup & Restore: Pandoria now automatically saves your progress (in both the TMX editor and the alignment tool) to your browser's local storage. If you accidentally close the tab or browser, a prompt will appear the next time you open the application, asking if you want to restore the previous session. The backup is automatically cleared when you create a "New TMX" or "Download TMX," ensuring a clean start.

Key Features

### TMX Editor Features

* **Create, Import & Download TMX**: You can create a new Translation Memory (TMX) from scratch by defining language pairs, or import an existing TMX file to continue your work. When you're done, export your work as a standard TMX 1.4 file.
* **Direct Inline Editing**: Edit source and target segments directly within the main table for a fast and seamless workflow.
* **Add & Delete Entries**: Easily add new translation units to your TM or delete unwanted ones with a single click.
* **Live Search**: Quickly filter your entire translation memory by searching for terms in both the source and target languages simultaneously.
* **Undo Support**: Reverse any recent changes (additions, edits, or deletions) with the dedicated Undo button or the universal Ctrl+Z shortcut.

### Text Alignment Tool

* **Create TMs from Existing Texts**: Align a source document with its translation to create a brand new TMX file from scratch.
* **Multiple Input Formats**: You can upload plain text (`.txt`) or subtitle files (`.srt`). The tool automatically parses the text content from SRT files. You can also paste your texts directly into the provided areas.
* **Alignment Wizard**: If your source and target texts have a different number of lines, Pandoria launches a powerful wizard. This side-by-side view allows you to manually edit, merge, or add lines to ensure the segments are perfectly matched before the TM is created.
* **Multilingual UI**: The Pandoria interface is available in both English and Spanish.
