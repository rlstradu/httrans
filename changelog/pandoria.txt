Key Features

### TMX Editor Features

* **Create, Import & Download TMX**: You can create a new Translation Memory (TMX) from scratch by defining language pairs, or import an existing TMX file to continue your work. When you're done, export your work as a standard TMX 1.4 file.
* **Direct Inline Editing**: Edit source and target segments directly within the main table for a fast and seamless workflow.
* **Add & Delete Entries**: Easily add new translation units to your TM or delete unwanted ones with a single click.
* **Live Search**: Quickly filter your entire translation memory by searching for terms in both the source and target languages simultaneously.
* **Undo Support**: Reverse any recent changes (additions, edits, or deletions) with the dedicated Undo button or the universal Ctrl+Z shortcut.

### Text Alignment Tool

* **Create TMs from Existing Texts**: Align a source document with its translation to create a brand new TMX file from scratch.
* **Multiple Input Formats**: You can upload plain text (`.txt`) or subtitle files (`.srt`). The tool automatically parses the text content from SRT files. You can also paste your texts directly into the provided areas.
* **Alignment Wizard**: If your source and target texts have a different number of lines, Pandoria launches a powerful wizard. This side-by-side view allows you to manually edit, merge, or add lines to ensure the segments are perfectly matched before the TM is created.
* **Multilingual UI**: The Pandoria interface is available in both English and Spanish.
