=========================================
SubPandaQA v1.1.0 - The Categorization Update
=========================================

Release Date: October 19, 2025

This update introduces a major new feature: error categorization. All errors are now grouped into logical categories, complete with new UI elements and color-coding, to help you prioritize your QA workflow. This release also includes two new filters and several important improvements to existing checks.

New Features

### Error Categorization

All filters and errors are now classified into four distinct categories to improve clarity and workflow:

- **Rules (Blue):** Project-specific conventions (CPS, CPL, line limits, etc.).
- **Timing (Green):** Duration, gaps, overlaps, and spotting.
- **Spelling (Red):** Punctuation, grammar, typos, and orthography.
- **Tags (Magenta):** HTML tag formatting and integrity.

**New UI:** The "Configure filters" section now groups all filters by their category, making the list easier to navigate.

**Color-Coded Results:** Errors in the results list, the exported PDF, and the HTML table are now color-coded to match their category, allowing for at-a-glance identification of error types.

---
New Filters
---

- **Space After Dash:** Added a new *opt-in* filter (`filter_space_after_dash`) to detect dialogue that *does* contain a space after a dash (e.g., "- Hello"). This is intended for style guides that specifically require omitting the space (e.g., "-Hello").
- **Forbidden Sequences:** Added a new *opt-in* filter (`filter_forbidden_sequences`) with a customizable text field. This allows you to detect any custom sequence of characters (e.g., '..', ',.', '.?'). Multiple sequences can be added, separated by a space.

---
Improvements & Bug Fixes
---

- **Character Limit (CPL):** The Character Limit check (`filter_char_limit`) now correctly **ignores** HTML tags when counting characters, preventing false positives on formatted lines.
- **Reading Speed (CPS/WPM):** CPS and WPM calculations are now more accurate. The CPS check (`filter_cps`) ignores newlines in its count, while the WWPM check (`filter_wpm`) treats newlines as a word separator.
- **Unclosed Quotes (Apostrophe-safe):** The "Unclosed Quotes" check (`filter_unclosed_quotes`) is now **apostrophe-safe**. It correctly ignores apostrophes inside words (e.g., "it's", "don't") and will no longer flag them as unclosed single quotes.
- **SFX/Description Detection:** The "SFX/Description" check (`filter_ids_sfx_format`) has been expanded. It now detects text enclosed in both **[square brackets]** and **(parentheses)**.
- **Punctuation Checks (Tags):** Punctuation checks like "No Space After Period" (`filter_no_space_after_period`) now properly ignore HTML tags, preventing false positives where a period is followed by a tag (e.g., 'Hello.</i>').
- **Quote Punctuation:** The "No Period After Quote" check (`filter_no_period_after_quote`) has been improved to ignore lines ending in `?"` or `!"`, reducing false positives.
- **Error Message Detail:** Error messages for "Minimum Gap" (`gap_too_small`) and "Overlap" (`overlap`) are now more descriptive, providing the exact timestamps and subtitle indexes involved to make debugging faster.
- **Filter Default State:** The new "Space After Dash" and "Forbidden Sequences" filters, along with the "WPM" filter, are now disabled by default.

 SubPandaQA v1.0.0 - Launch Announcement
=========================================

Release Date: July 28, 2025

SubPandaQA is a powerful and detailed quality assurance tool for subtitle professionals. Designed to run entirely in your browser, SubPandaQA analyzes SRT files to detect a wide range of common technical, formatting, and stylistic errors, helping you deliver flawless subtitles.

### Comprehensive Error Checking

SubPandaQA comes with a suite of over 25 configurable checks to validate your subtitle files against common industry standards and style guides.

**Technical & Timing Checks:**
* **Reading Speed**: Detects subtitles that exceed configurable Characters Per Second (CPS) or Words Per Minute (WPM) limits.
* **Duration**: Flags subtitles that are too short (less than 1s) or too long (more than 7s).
* **Minimum Gap**: Checks for insufficient time gaps between consecutive subtitles, configurable in milliseconds or frames.
* **Overlaps**: Identifies any subtitles with timestamps that overlap with the following subtitle.
* **Tag Issues**: Finds unclosed, unopened, or malformed HTML tags (<i>, <b>, <font>).
* **Empty Subtitles**: Detects subtitles that contain no text.
* **SFX/Descriptions**: Identifies text enclosed in square brackets, which typically indicates sound effects or descriptions (e.g., [Music]).

**Formatting & Punctuation Checks:**
* **Line & Character Limits**: Verifies that subtitles do not exceed the configured character-per-line and line-per-subtitle limits.
* **Dialogue Dashes**: Ensures a space follows a leading dash in a line of dialogue.
* **Double Spaces**: Finds instances of two or more consecutive spaces within the text.
* **Spanish Punctuation**: Checks for missing opening (¿, ¡) or closing (?, !) marks in questions and exclamations.
* **Punctuation & Quotes**: Validates that punctuation is correctly placed outside of closing quotation marks and that all quotes are properly closed.
* **Ellipsis Character**: Detects the use of three dots (...) instead of the correct single ellipsis character (…), and flags ellipses at the end of lines that may indicate linking issues.
* **Number Punctuation**: Identifies English-style thousand separators (commas) in numbers.

**Style & Consistency Checks:**
* **Acronyms & Units**: Flags acronyms with incorrect formatting (e.g., "F.B.I") and measurement units with incorrect formatting (e.g., plurals or periods).
* **Dialogue Hyphens**: Detects inconsistencies in dual-speaker subtitles where one line has a hyphen and the other does not.
* **Numbers as Words**: Checks if numbers from 1 to 10 are written as digits instead of words.
* **Thousand Separators**: Flags 4-digit numbers that incorrectly use a thousand separator (e.g., "1,234" instead of "1234").
* **General Punctuation**: Detects the use of semicolons and checks for missing spaces after periods.

### Filter Customization & Management

* **Granular Control**: Every check can be individually enabled or disabled to match your project's specific requirements.
* **Parameter Adjustment**: Key metrics like CPS, WPM, character limits, and gap duration are fully configurable.
* **Save & Import Profiles**: Save your complete filter configuration to a JSON file and import it later, making it easy to switch between different client style guides.

### Reporting & Export

* **Clear Results**: Errors are displayed in a clean, easy-to-read format, grouped by subtitle with timestamps and the full text for context.
* **PDF & HTML Export**: Export the full error report to a formatted PDF or a simple HTML table for sharing with colleagues or for archiving.
