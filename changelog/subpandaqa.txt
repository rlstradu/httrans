### Comprehensive Error Checking

SubPandaQA comes with a suite of over 25 configurable checks to validate your subtitle files against common industry standards and style guides.

**Technical & Timing Checks:**
* **Reading Speed**: Detects subtitles that exceed configurable Characters Per Second (CPS) or Words Per Minute (WPM) limits.
* **Duration**: Flags subtitles that are too short (less than 1s) or too long (more than 7s).
* **Minimum Gap**: Checks for insufficient time gaps between consecutive subtitles, configurable in milliseconds or frames.
* **Overlaps**: Identifies any subtitles with timestamps that overlap with the following subtitle.
* **Tag Issues**: Finds unclosed, unopened, or malformed HTML tags (<i>, <b>, <font>).
* **Empty Subtitles**: Detects subtitles that contain no text.
* **SFX/Descriptions**: Identifies text enclosed in square brackets, which typically indicates sound effects or descriptions (e.g., [Music]).

**Formatting & Punctuation Checks:**
* **Line & Character Limits**: Verifies that subtitles do not exceed the configured character-per-line and line-per-subtitle limits.
* **Dialogue Dashes**: Ensures a space follows a leading dash in a line of dialogue.
* **Double Spaces**: Finds instances of two or more consecutive spaces within the text.
* **Spanish Punctuation**: Checks for missing opening (¿, ¡) or closing (?, !) marks in questions and exclamations.
* **Punctuation & Quotes**: Validates that punctuation is correctly placed outside of closing quotation marks and that all quotes are properly closed.
* **Ellipsis Character**: Detects the use of three dots (...) instead of the correct single ellipsis character (…), and flags ellipses at the end of lines that may indicate linking issues.
* **Number Punctuation**: Identifies English-style thousand separators (commas) in numbers.

**Style & Consistency Checks:**
* **Acronyms & Units**: Flags acronyms with incorrect formatting (e.g., "F.B.I") and measurement units with incorrect formatting (e.g., plurals or periods).
* **Dialogue Hyphens**: Detects inconsistencies in dual-speaker subtitles where one line has a hyphen and the other does not.
* **Numbers as Words**: Checks if numbers from 1 to 10 are written as digits instead of words.
* **Thousand Separators**: Flags 4-digit numbers that incorrectly use a thousand separator (e.g., "1,234" instead of "1234").
* **General Punctuation**: Detects the use of semicolons and checks for missing spaces after periods.

### Filter Customization & Management

* **Granular Control**: Every check can be individually enabled or disabled to match your project's specific requirements.
* **Parameter Adjustment**: Key metrics like CPS, WPM, character limits, and gap duration are fully configurable.
* **Save & Import Profiles**: Save your complete filter configuration to a JSON file and import it later, making it easy to switch between different client style guides.

### Reporting & Export

* **Clear Results**: Errors are displayed in a clean, easy-to-read format, grouped by subtitle with timestamps and the full text for context.
* **PDF & HTML Export**: Export the full error report to a formatted PDF or a simple HTML table for sharing with colleagues or for archiving.
