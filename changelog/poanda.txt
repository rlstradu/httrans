Improvements & Fixes

=======================================

Release Date: July 28, 2025

Key Features
---

### Core Translation Workflow

* **Load & Edit .po Files**: Easily load your .po files via the file dialog or by dragging and dropping them directly into the application.
* **Segment-by-Segment Editor**: A clean, two-column layout to compare the original (msgid) and the translation (msgstr). Support for context (msgctxt) is included.
* **Real-time Statistics**: Keep track of your progress with a live-updating stats bar showing segment completion, total words, translated words, and remaining words.
* **PO to MO Conversion**: Compile your final .po file into a binary .mo file directly in the browser, ready for use.
* **In-File Search**: Quickly search for text within the original or translated segments of your PO file.

### Professional CAT Tool Features

* **Translation Memory (TM)**:
    * Import and export standard TMX files.
    * The TM is automatically populated with your validated translations as you work.
    * Get fuzzy match suggestions (with a similarity score) for the active segment.
    * A diff view highlights the differences between the source text and the TM match.

* **Terminology (Glossary)**:
    * Import and export standard TBX files.
    * Build and maintain a project-specific glossary.
    * Terms from your glossary are automatically highlighted in the current source segment.

### Productivity and Quality of Life

* **Customizable Keyboard Shortcuts**: Speed up your workflow with shortcuts for validating, navigating segments, and inserting TM/Glossory matches. You can customize them and even import/export your configuration.
* **Powerful Find & Replace**: A dedicated modal for finding and replacing text across all translation segments, with support for case sensitivity and regular expressions.
* **Automatic Data Backup**: Poanda automatically saves your entire session (PO file, TM, and Glossary) to your browser's local storage every 10 seconds.
* **Session Restore**: If you accidentally close your browser, Poanda will ask if you want to restore your previous session upon reopening. You can also save/load backups to/from a file.
* **Customizable Interface**: The Terminology and Translation Memory sidebars are fully draggable and resizable to fit your screen and workflow.
* **Multilingual UI**: The Poanda interface is available in both English and Spanish.

### Project Management

* **Poanda Projects (.poanda)**: Save your entire workspace—the .po file, the Translation Memory, and the Terminology—into a single `.poanda` project file (a zip archive).
* **Easy Project Handling**: Start a new project, open an existing one, or save your current work for later.
