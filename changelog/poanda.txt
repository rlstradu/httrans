=======================================
Poanda v1.0.2 - JSON Support & Workflow Enhancements
=======================================

Release Date: October 23, 2025

This release introduces a major new feature: the ability to translate simple key-value JSON files directly within Poanda. Additionally, several workflow enhancements have been added based on user feedback to improve efficiency during translation.

New Features & Improvements
---------------------------
* **Direct JSON File Translation:** Added the capability to load single `.json` files (simple key-value format) via the new "File" > "Load JSON File" menu. Poanda will display the JSON key as the context (`msgctxt`) and the original value as the source text (`msgid`), leaving the translation field (`msgstr`) empty for you to fill in.
* **Save Translations as JSON:** Complementing the loading feature, you can now save your work back into a `.json` file using "File" > "Save JSON File". Poanda will prompt for a filename and export the context (`msgctxt`) as the key and the translated text (`msgstr`) as the value.
* **New "File" Menu:** Introduced a dedicated "File" menu in the top utility bar, organizing file operations. Existing actions ("Load .po", "Save .po", "Convert to .mo") are now accessible here alongside the new JSON options, while the quick access buttons remain on the main interface for convenience.
* **"Copy Original to Translation" Button:** Added a new icon button (copy icon) next to the "Validate" button within each translation segment. Clicking this button instantly copies the full text from the "Original (msgid)" field into the "Translation (msgstr)" field, useful for minor edits or as a starting point. A tooltip clarifies the button's action on hover.

Poanda v1.0.1 - UX & Clarity Update
=======================================

Release Date: August 9, 2025

This is a minor update focused on improving the user experience based on initial feedback. The main goal of this release is to make the project creation workflow more intuitive and clear for new users.

Improvements & Fixes
Enhanced 'New Project' Workflow: Addressed a point of confusion for new users. The application now starts with a clearer welcome message explaining that you are already in a new project. Additionally, the 'New Project' button will now always show a confirmation dialog, providing consistent feedback and preventing accidental data loss.

Key Features

### Core Translation Workflow

* **Load & Edit .po Files**: Easily load your .po files via the file dialog or by dragging and dropping them directly into the application.
* **Segment-by-Segment Editor**: A clean, two-column layout to compare the original (msgid) and the translation (msgstr). Support for context (msgctxt) is included.
* **Real-time Statistics**: Keep track of your progress with a live-updating stats bar showing segment completion, total words, translated words, and remaining words.
* **PO to MO Conversion**: Compile your final .po file into a binary .mo file directly in the browser, ready for use.
* **In-File Search**: Quickly search for text within the original or translated segments of your PO file.

### Professional CAT Tool Features

* **Translation Memory (TM)**:
    * Import and export standard TMX files.
    * The TM is automatically populated with your validated translations as you work.
    * Get fuzzy match suggestions (with a similarity score) for the active segment.
    * A diff view highlights the differences between the source text and the TM match.

* **Terminology (Glossary)**:
    * Import and export standard TBX files.
    * Build and maintain a project-specific glossary.
    * Terms from your glossary are automatically highlighted in the current source segment.

### Productivity and Quality of Life

* **Customizable Keyboard Shortcuts**: Speed up your workflow with shortcuts for validating, navigating segments, and inserting TM/Glossory matches. You can customize them and even import/export your configuration.
* **Powerful Find & Replace**: A dedicated modal for finding and replacing text across all translation segments, with support for case sensitivity and regular expressions.
* **Automatic Data Backup**: Poanda automatically saves your entire session (PO file, TM, and Glossary) to your browser's local storage every 10 seconds.
* **Session Restore**: If you accidentally close your browser, Poanda will ask if you want to restore your previous session upon reopening. You can also save/load backups to/from a file.
* **Customizable Interface**: The Terminology and Translation Memory sidebars are fully draggable and resizable to fit your screen and workflow.
* **Multilingual UI**: The Poanda interface is available in both English and Spanish.

### Project Management

* **Poanda Projects (.poanda)**: Save your entire workspace—the .po file, the Translation Memory, and the Terminology—into a single `.poanda` project file (a zip archive).
* **Easy Project Handling**: Start a new project, open an existing one, or save your current work for later.
