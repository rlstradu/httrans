======================================= 
Poanda v1.0.4 - AI Assistant & Dark Mode
======================================= 

Release Date: December 15, 2025

This milestone update introduces PandaBot, a brand-new AI assistant built directly into Poanda to help you translate faster and better. Alongside this major addition, we have implemented a native Dark Mode to reduce eye strain and reorganized the interface to keep your workspace clean and efficient.

New Features & Improvements 
New AI Assistant (PandaBot): You can now access a smart sidekick powered by Google Gemini directly within the editor. PandaBot allows you to chat, ask for translations, or use quick actions (Translate, Improve, Explain, Fix) without leaving your project.

Context-Aware Intelligence: Unlike a generic chatbot, PandaBot is aware of your work. When you ask for help, it automatically considers the previous and next segments for context, strictly adheres to your active Glossary terms, and references Translation Memory matches, ensuring consistent and accurate suggestions.

Native Dark Mode: Save your eyes during late-night sessions with the new Dark Mode. Toggle it via the moon icon (🌙) next to the language selector. We’ve carefully tuned the color palette with deep grays and optimized contrast for buttons, tables, and text inputs to ensure perfect readability.

Streamlined Toolbar: The top menu has been reorganized. Less frequently used utilities (Find & Replace, Shortcuts, Statistics) are now grouped under a new "Tools" dropdown menu, decluttering the main workspace.

Enhanced Search Bar: The "Auto-propagate translations" option has been integrated directly into the Search container to save vertical space, separating it from search filters with a clean visual divider.

New Shortcuts:

Ctrl + Shift + A: Toggles the AI sidebar and smartly manages focus (auto-focusing the chat when opening, and returning focus to your active translation segment when closing).

Ctrl + Alt + I: Instantly inserts the last AI response into your current translation segment.

Refinements & Fixes AI Localization: The entire AI interface (buttons, welcome messages, placeholders, and configuration settings) is fully localized and switches dynamically between English and Spanish based on your interface language preference.

Smart Link Formatting: When the AI provides reference links, they now appear as small, unobtrusive "Source" buttons that open in a new tab, rather than cluttering the chat with long URLs.

Markdown Rendering: AI responses are now properly formatted with lists, bold text, and paragraphs for better readability.

Poanda v1.0.3 - Glossary Visuals & Stability
======================================= 

Release Date: November 24, 2025

This update brings a highly requested feature from SubpandaTM to Poanda: visual glossary aids directly in the editor. We have also focused heavily on stability, specifically addressing issues where save buttons would become unresponsive during long translation sessions or after reloading.

New Features & Improvements
Visual Glossary Matches: Inspired by SubpandaTM, Poanda now displays a yellow badge directly above the translation field whenever terms from your active glossary are detected in the source text. This badge provides an immediate reference of the "Source Term -> Target Term" pair.

Responsive Glossary Labels: The new glossary badge is designed to adapt to content length. Instead of truncating long terms with ellipses (...), the label now wraps text automatically, ensuring that complex terminology is fully visible without hovering.

Bug Fixes & Stability
Persistent Save Functionality: Fixed a critical logic error where the "Save .po File" button (both the main button and the File menu item) would incorrectly disable itself after validating a segment. The editor now uses a more robust check to ensure save options remain available as long as data exists.

Session Restoration Improvements: The backup and restore system now correctly saves and retrieves the active file type (.po vs .json). This ensures that when you reload the page or restore a session, the editor "remembers" exactly which mode you were working in, keeping the correct save buttons enabled.

=======================================
Poanda v1.0.2 - JSON Support & Workflow Enhancements
=======================================

Release Date: October 23, 2025

This release introduces a major new feature: the ability to translate simple key-value JSON files directly within Poanda. Additionally, several workflow enhancements have been added based on user feedback to improve efficiency during translation.

New Features & Improvements
---------------------------
* **Direct JSON File Translation:** Added the capability to load single `.json` files (simple key-value format) via the new "File" > "Load JSON File" menu. Poanda will display the JSON key as the context (`msgctxt`) and the original value as the source text (`msgid`), leaving the translation field (`msgstr`) empty for you to fill in.
* **Save Translations as JSON:** Complementing the loading feature, you can now save your work back into a `.json` file using "File" > "Save JSON File". Poanda will prompt for a filename and export the context (`msgctxt`) as the key and the translated text (`msgstr`) as the value.
* **New "File" Menu:** Introduced a dedicated "File" menu in the top utility bar, organizing file operations. Existing actions ("Load .po", "Save .po", "Convert to .mo") are now accessible here alongside the new JSON options, while the quick access buttons remain on the main interface for convenience.
* **"Copy Original to Translation" Button:** Added a new icon button (copy icon) next to the "Validate" button within each translation segment. Clicking this button instantly copies the full text from the "Original (msgid)" field into the "Translation (msgstr)" field, useful for minor edits or as a starting point. A tooltip clarifies the button's action on hover.

=======================================
Poanda v1.0.1 - UX & Clarity Update
=======================================

Release Date: August 9, 2025

This is a minor update focused on improving the user experience based on initial feedback. The main goal of this release is to make the project creation workflow more intuitive and clear for new users.

Improvements & Fixes
Enhanced 'New Project' Workflow: Addressed a point of confusion for new users. The application now starts with a clearer welcome message explaining that you are already in a new project. Additionally, the 'New Project' button will now always show a confirmation dialog, providing consistent feedback and preventing accidental data loss.

=======================================

    * The TM is automatically populated with your validated translations as you work.
    * Get fuzzy match suggestions (with a similarity score) for the active segment.
    * A diff view highlights the differences between the source text and the TM match.

* **Terminology (Glossary)**:
    * Import and export standard TBX files.

    * Terms from your glossary are automatically highlighted in the current source segment.

* **Powerful Find & Replace**: A dedicated modal for finding and replacing text across all translation segments, with support for case sensitivity and regular expressions.
* **Automatic Data Backup**: Poanda automatically saves your entire session (PO file, TM, and Glossary) to your browser's local storage every 10 seconds.
* **Session Restore**: If you accidentally close your browser, Poanda will ask if you want to restore your previous session upon reopening. You can also save/load backups to/from a file.
* **Customizable Interface**: The Terminology and Translation Memory sidebars are fully draggable and resizable to fit your screen and workflow.
* **Multilingual UI**: The Poanda interface is available in both English and Spanish.
