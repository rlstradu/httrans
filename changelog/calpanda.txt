 CalPanda v1.0.1 - July 31, 2025
=======================================

This update focuses on improving the internationalization (i18n) support and fixing user interface bugs for a smoother experience.

Bug Fixes & Improvements
Fixed Decimal Separator Toggle: The button to switch between decimal point (.) and decimal comma (,) now correctly displays the action to be performed, rather than showing the current state. This makes the button's function more intuitive for the user.

Corrected PDF Generation Modal: The dialog box that appears after clicking "Generate PDF" is now fully translated into English. This includes the modal title, the "File name:" label, and the "Generate" button.

Enhanced Internationalization: Completed all English translations across all modals (including Save to File, Load from File, Save Locally, and Load Locally) to ensure a fully consistent bilingual experience. All labels, buttons, and explanatory texts in pop-up dialogs will now correctly switch between Spanish and English.

Key Features

### Invoice Creation & Customization

* **Fully Editable Template**: Almost every label on the invoice is editable, from "Client details:" and "Invoice number:" to the table headers, allowing for complete personalization of your document.
* **Dynamic Item List**: Add as many line items as you need to your invoice. Each item can be based on a rate and volume, or set as a single flat-price entry for fixed-cost projects.
* **Flexible Descriptions**: Use multi-line descriptions for each invoice item to provide detailed information about the services rendered.

### Financial Calculations

* **Automatic Totals**: Subtotals and the final grand total are calculated automatically in real-time as you add or edit items.
* **Custom Taxes & Deductions**: Add multiple custom taxes or deductions. Each can be set as a positive percentage (like VAT) or a negative percentage (like a withholding tax), providing full flexibility.
* **Decimal Separator Toggle**: Instantly switch between using a decimal point (0.00) or a comma (0,00) for all monetary values to suit your regional formatting needs.

### Template & Data Management

* **Save & Load Configurations**: Save your entire invoice setup—including client data, your details, custom labels, and tax settings—as a reusable template.
* **Local & File-Based Storage**: Save templates directly in your browser for quick, private access, or download them as a `.json` file to share, back up, or use on another machine.
* **Multilingual Interface**: The CalPanda interface is available in both English and Spanish.

### Exporting

* **Professional PDF Export**: Generate a clean, professional-looking PDF of your invoice with a single click, ready to be sent to your client.
