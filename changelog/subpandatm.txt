## New Features & Improvements

* **Undo/Redo System**:

    * **Split**: Divide the current subtitle into two at the cursor's position.
    * **Delete**: Remove the current subtitle (with confirmation).

* **Project Planner**:
    * A new collapsible panel in the video section allows you to divide the project into manageable sessions.
    * Calculate sessions based on the number of subtitles, word count, or video time.
    * Track time spent on each session with integrated start/pause/reset timers.
    * Includes a final session dedicated to Review/QA.

* **Navigation & UI Enhancements**:
    * **"Go To..." Panel**: A new floating panel allows jumping directly to a specific subtitle number or timecode.
    * **"Tools" Menu**: A new dropdown menu consolidates Undo, Redo, Find & Replace, Shortcuts, and the new "Go To..." function.
    * **"Validate All Previous" Button**: Quickly validate the current subtitle and all preceding unvalidated ones.
    * **Redesigned Video Player Controls**: Controls are now in a sleek top bar that appears on hover, including:
        * Buttons to switch the **Subtitle Preview Overlay** between Original and Translation.
        * Dedicated buttons (+/-) for adjusting **Subtitle Preview Font Size**.
        * A custom **Fullscreen Button** designed for the application.
        * **Adaptive Controls**: The control bar layout adjusts automatically for smaller screen widths.
    * **Floating Find & Replace**: The Find & Replace tool is now a floating, draggable, and resizable panel instead of a modal.
    * **Line Break Tooltip**: A helpful tooltip reminds users that Shift+Enter creates line breaks in the editor (can be dismissed).
    * **Improved Project Menu**: Now includes "Backup" and "Reset Application" options.
    * **Global Video Shortcuts**: Play/pause, seek, and play segment shortcuts now work even when the editor isn't focused.

* **Project Management**:
    * **Enhanced `.subpanda` Format**: Saving a project now correctly bundles *all* data including the session plan from the Planner.
    * **Application Reset**: A new option in the Project menu allows resetting the application completely, clearing all stored data (projects, backups, settings) in the browser.

* **AI Context Assistant**:
    * A new floating panel integrates AI suggestions directly into your workflow.
    * Generate a custom prompt based on your QA settings and additional instructions.
    * Copy the prompt to use with your preferred AI.
    * Import AI-generated JSON data (via file upload or pasting) to display contextual translation suggestions, explanations of idioms/references, and QA compliance notes directly within the panel for the active subtitle.
    * Customize AI prompts via a new settings modal.

* **Code & Stability**:
    * Refactored JavaScript for better organization and performance.
    * Improved handling of editor focus and state updates.
    * Fixed various minor bugs and improved overall stability.

subpandaTM v1.0.1 - Glossary workflow improved
=========================================

Release Date: September 14, 2025

This update focuses on improving the glossary workflow and overall application stability based on user feedback.

New Features & Improvements

* **Glossary Context Tooltip: A new context-aware tooltip now appears directly above the active subtitle you are translating. When a term from your glossary is detected in the source text, this tooltip instantly shows its corresponding translation, saving you from looking away to the terminology panel and speeding up your work.

* **Editor Stability and Workflow Fix: A critical issue has been resolved where adding or deleting a term from the glossary would cause the entire subtitle editor to refresh. This interruption not only caused users to lose their scroll position, but also incorrectly reset the confirmed status of already validated subtitles. The update process is now instantaneous, preserving both your position in the editor and the status of all your subtitles for a seamless workflow.

* **Overhauled TMX Export Engine for Professional Compatibility: The TMX export function has been rebuilt from the ground up to generate clean, valid files compliant with the TMX 1.4b standard. This resolves all previously encountered import errors in industry-standard CAT tools, allowing for a seamless workflow between subpandaTM and other platforms.

* **Improved TMX Import and HTML Formatting Preservation: The TMX importer is now more robust and correctly interprets standard-compliant files. Crucially, any HTML formatting tags (like <i> for italics or <br> for line breaks) are now properly handled during both export and import. This means formatting is perfectly preserved when moving TMs between applications, and it will be rendered correctly in the editor, not as plain text.

* **Note on Legacy TMX Files: Due to these improvements, the importer is now stricter and will reject old TMX files that were generated with previous, buggy versions. To upgrade your old TMX files, simply load them into your new version of subpandaTM and re-export them. The new export process will automatically clean and fix the file structure, making them permanently compatible.

Special Thanks
A special thank you to all the students of Damián Santilli's subtitling specialization for their invaluable feedback and suggestions, which were crucial for this update.

 subpandaTM v1.0.0 - Launch Announcement
=========================================

Release Date: July 28, 2025

SubpandaTM is an all-in-one subtitle translation environment that runs entirely in your browser. It combines a synchronized video player, a powerful subtitle editor, and professional CAT (Computer-Assisted Translation) tools to streamline your entire workflow, all while keeping your data private and offline.

---
Key Features
---

### Integrated Translation Environment

* **Synchronized Video Player**: Load your video and see it alongside your SRT file. Clicking a subtitle in the editor jumps the video to the correct time, and the video player can be controlled with extensive keyboard shortcuts.
* **Subtitle Preview Overlay**: See how your translation will look on-screen with a live preview overlay on the video player. You can customize the font size and switch between viewing the original or the translated text.
* **Side-by-Side Editor**: A clear editor view showing the original text next to a rich-text field for your translation for each subtitle entry.
* **Real-time QA Checks**: Get instant feedback on your translations. The tool automatically checks for and flags issues related to Characters Per Second (CPS) and characters-per-line limits based on your settings.

### Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) Tools

* **Translation Memory (TM)**: Import and export standard TMX files or create a TM from scratch. Get fuzzy match suggestions with similarity scores and a color-coded "diff" view that highlights the exact differences between the source text and the TM match.
* **Terminology (Glossary)**: Manage your project's terminology with full TBX import/export support. Terms from your glossary are automatically highlighted in the source text for easy reference.
* **Floating Panels**: The TM and Terminology tools are housed in fully draggable and resizable floating windows, allowing you to create a completely custom workspace.

### Productivity & Workflow

* **Comprehensive Shortcut System**: A massive set of keyboard shortcuts covers nearly every action: video playback, navigating between subtitles, inserting TM and glossary suggestions, and applying text formatting. The entire shortcut map can be customized, saved, and imported.
* **Find & Replace**: A powerful tool to find and replace text across all subtitles in your file, with support for case sensitivity and regular expressions.
* **Statistics Panel**: A collapsible panel keeps track of your progress, showing translated segments, word counts, and a summary of QA errors.

### Project Management & Data Safety

* **Full Project Files (.subpanda)**: Save your entire workspace—including the SRT file, TM, glossary, video reference, and settings—into a single `.subpanda` project file.
* **Automatic Backup**: Your session is automatically backed up to your browser's local storage (IndexedDB) to prevent data loss. The tool will notify you if a restorable backup is available.
* **Multilingual Interface**: The application is available in both English and Spanish.
