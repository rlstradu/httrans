subpandaTM v1.1.2 - Visual CPS Feedback
=========================================

Release Date: October 24, 2025
This version introduces a highly requested visual aid for translation quality control.

New Features & Improvements
Visual CPS Progress Bar: A thin, interactive bar is now displayed below the translation editor for each subtitle, offering immediate feedback on reading speed.

The bar fills dynamically based on the current Characters Per Second (CPS) rate.

A limit marker indicates the maximum CPS configured in the QA settings.

The bar changes color from green to red when the calculated CPS exceeds the set limit, providing an instant visual warning.

subpandaTM v1.1.1 - Waveform Integration & Advanced Timecode Control
=========================================

Release Date: October 22, 2025

This version introduces a major new feature: an interactive audio waveform display powered by Wavesurfer.js. It also significantly enhances timecode management with FPS settings, frame-based display, and improved editing precision, along with UI refinements like a persistent status bar.

## New Features & Improvements

* **Audio Waveform Integration**:
    * A **visual audio waveform** now appears below the video player when a video is loaded.
    * Subtitles are displayed as **interactive regions** on the waveform.
    * Region Content: Each region shows subtitle number, original/translation text preview, and key stats (CPS, line lengths).
    * **Click to Navigate**: Clicking a region jumps the video and editor focus to that subtitle.
    * **Drag & Resize Timing**: Drag regions or their handles to visually adjust subtitle start/end times (can be locked). Changes are reflected in the editor and are undoable.
    * **Waveform Controls**: New controls added below the waveform:
        * **Lock/Unlock**: Prevent accidental timing changes.
        * **Zoom In/Out**: Adjust the waveform's horizontal zoom level.
        * **Follow Playback**: Toggle mode where the waveform scrolls automatically, and the active subtitle region/editor unit is highlighted/focused during video playback.

* **Advanced Timecode Management**:
    * **Project FPS Settings**: A new "Timecode Settings" option under the "Tools" menu opens a modal to define the project's Frames Per Second (FPS).
    * **Frame-Based Display**: Option in Timecode Settings to display and edit timecodes in `HH:MM:SS:FF` format (SRT export remains in milliseconds for compatibility).
    * **Frame-Accurate Nudging**: Timecode nudge buttons now adjust timing by exactly one frame based on the set project FPS.
    * **Undo/Redo for Time Changes**: All timing adjustments (manual input, nudging, waveform region manipulation) are now correctly tracked in the Undo/Redo history.

* **UI & UX Enhancements**:
    * **Persistent Status Bar**: Replaces the collapsible Statistics panel with a permanent bar at the bottom displaying progress, word counts, and QA status. Can be toggled via the "Tools" menu.
    * **Improved Playback Tracking**: Editor focus and highlighting now reliably follow video playback when "Follow Playback" is enabled.
    * **Refined Play Segment Behavior**: The "Play Segment" action (and shortcut) now plays precisely until the subtitle's end time.
    * Improved active/hover states for toggle buttons.

* **Bug Fixes**:
    * **Split Subtitle Gap**: The "Split" function now correctly calculates and inserts a 2-frame gap based on the project FPS.

=========================================
subpandaTM v1.0.1 - Glossary workflow improved
=========================================

Release Date: September 14, 2025

This update focuses on improving the glossary workflow and overall application stability based on user feedback.

New Features & Improvements

* **Glossary Context Tooltip: A new context-aware tooltip now appears directly above the active subtitle you are translating. When a term from your glossary is detected in the source text, this tooltip instantly shows its corresponding translation, saving you from looking away to the terminology panel and speeding up your work.

* **Editor Stability and Workflow Fix: A critical issue has been resolved where adding or deleting a term from the glossary would cause the entire subtitle editor to refresh. This interruption not only caused users to lose their scroll position, but also incorrectly reset the confirmed status of already validated subtitles. The update process is now instantaneous, preserving both your position in the editor and the status of all your subtitles for a seamless workflow.

* **Overhauled TMX Export Engine for Professional Compatibility: The TMX export function has been rebuilt from the ground up to generate clean, valid files compliant with the TMX 1.4b standard. This resolves all previously encountered import errors in industry-standard CAT tools, allowing for a seamless workflow between subpandaTM and other platforms.

* **Improved TMX Import and HTML Formatting Preservation: The TMX importer is now more robust and correctly interprets standard-compliant files. Crucially, any HTML formatting tags (like <i> for italics or <br> for line breaks) are now properly handled during both export and import. This means formatting is perfectly preserved when moving TMs between applications, and it will be rendered correctly in the editor, not as plain text.

* **Note on Legacy TMX Files: Due to these improvements, the importer is now stricter and will reject old TMX files that were generated with previous, buggy versions. To upgrade your old TMX files, simply load them into your new version of subpandaTM and re-export them. The new export process will automatically clean and fix the file structure, making them permanently compatible.

Special Thanks
A special thank you to all the students of Damián Santilli's subtitling specialization for their invaluable feedback and suggestions, which were crucial for this update.

Release Date: July 28, 2025

SubpandaTM is an all-in-one subtitle translation environment that runs entirely in your browser. It combines a synchronized video player, a powerful subtitle editor, and professional CAT (Computer-Assisted Translation) tools to streamline your entire workflow, all while keeping your data private and offline.

---
Key Features
---

### Integrated Translation Environment

* **Synchronized Video Player**: Load your video and see it alongside your SRT file. Clicking a subtitle in the editor jumps the video to the correct time, and the video player can be controlled with extensive keyboard shortcuts.
* **Subtitle Preview Overlay**: See how your translation will look on-screen with a live preview overlay on the video player. You can customize the font size and switch between viewing the original or the translated text.
* **Side-by-Side Editor**: A clear editor view showing the original text next to a rich-text field for your translation for each subtitle entry.
* **Real-time QA Checks**: Get instant feedback on your translations. The tool automatically checks for and flags issues related to Characters Per Second (CPS) and characters-per-line limits based on your settings.

### Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) Tools

* **Translation Memory (TM)**: Import and export standard TMX files or create a TM from scratch. Get fuzzy match suggestions with similarity scores and a color-coded "diff" view that highlights the exact differences between the source text and the TM match.
* **Terminology (Glossary)**: Manage your project's terminology with full TBX import/export support. Terms from your glossary are automatically highlighted in the source text for easy reference.
* **Floating Panels**: The TM and Terminology tools are housed in fully draggable and resizable floating windows, allowing you to create a completely custom workspace.

### Productivity & Workflow

* **Comprehensive Shortcut System**: A massive set of keyboard shortcuts covers nearly every action: video playback, navigating between subtitles, inserting TM and glossary suggestions, and applying text formatting. The entire shortcut map can be customized, saved, and imported.
* **Find & Replace**: A powerful tool to find and replace text across all subtitles in your file, with support for case sensitivity and regular expressions.
* **Statistics Panel**: A collapsible panel keeps track of your progress, showing translated segments, word counts, and a summary of QA errors.

### Project Management & Data Safety

* **Full Project Files (.subpanda)**: Save your entire workspace—including the SRT file, TM, glossary, video reference, and settings—into a single `.subpanda` project file.
* **Automatic Backup**: Your session is automatically backed up to your browser's local storage (IndexedDB) to prevent data loss. The tool will notify you if a restorable backup is available.
* **Multilingual Interface**: The application is available in both English and Spanish.
