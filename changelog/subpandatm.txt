subpandaTM v1.0.1 - Glossary workflow improved
=========================================

Release Date: September 14, 2025

This update focuses on improving the glossary workflow and overall application stability based on user feedback.

New Features & Improvements
Glossary Context Tooltip: A new context-aware tooltip now appears directly above the active subtitle you are translating. When a term from your glossary is detected in the source text, this tooltip instantly shows its corresponding translation, saving you from looking away to the terminology panel and speeding up your work.

Editor Stability and Workflow Fix: A critical issue has been resolved where adding or deleting a term from the glossary would cause the entire subtitle editor to refresh. This interruption not only caused users to lose their scroll position, but also incorrectly reset the confirmed status of already validated subtitles. The update process is now instantaneous, preserving both your position in the editor and the status of all your subtitles for a seamless workflow.

Special Thanks
A special thank you to all the students of Damián Santilli's subtitling specialization for their invaluable feedback and suggestions, which were crucial for this update.

 subpandaTM v1.0.0 - Launch Announcement
=========================================

Release Date: July 28, 2025

SubpandaTM is an all-in-one subtitle translation environment that runs entirely in your browser. It combines a synchronized video player, a powerful subtitle editor, and professional CAT (Computer-Assisted Translation) tools to streamline your entire workflow, all while keeping your data private and offline.

Key Features
---

### Integrated Translation Environment

* **Synchronized Video Player**: Load your video and see it alongside your SRT file. Clicking a subtitle in the editor jumps the video to the correct time, and the video player can be controlled with extensive keyboard shortcuts.
* **Subtitle Preview Overlay**: See how your translation will look on-screen with a live preview overlay on the video player. You can customize the font size and switch between viewing the original or the translated text.
* **Side-by-Side Editor**: A clear editor view showing the original text next to a rich-text field for your translation for each subtitle entry.
* **Real-time QA Checks**: Get instant feedback on your translations. The tool automatically checks for and flags issues related to Characters Per Second (CPS) and characters-per-line limits based on your settings.

### Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) Tools

* **Translation Memory (TM)**: Import and export standard TMX files or create a TM from scratch. Get fuzzy match suggestions with similarity scores and a color-coded "diff" view that highlights the exact differences between the source text and the TM match.
* **Terminology (Glossary)**: Manage your project's terminology with full TBX import/export support. Terms from your glossary are automatically highlighted in the source text for easy reference.
* **Floating Panels**: The TM and Terminology tools are housed in fully draggable and resizable floating windows, allowing you to create a completely custom workspace.

### Productivity & Workflow

* **Comprehensive Shortcut System**: A massive set of keyboard shortcuts covers nearly every action: video playback, navigating between subtitles, inserting TM and glossary suggestions, and applying text formatting. The entire shortcut map can be customized, saved, and imported.
* **Find & Replace**: A powerful tool to find and replace text across all subtitles in your file, with support for case sensitivity and regular expressions.
* **Statistics Panel**: A collapsible panel keeps track of your progress, showing translated segments, word counts, and a summary of QA errors.

### Project Management & Data Safety

* **Full Project Files (.subpanda)**: Save your entire workspace—including the SRT file, TM, glossary, video reference, and settings—into a single `.subpanda` project file.
* **Automatic Backup**: Your session is automatically backed up to your browser's local storage (IndexedDB) to prevent data loss. The tool will notify you if a restorable backup is available.
* **Multilingual Interface**: The application is available in both English and Spanish.
