Key Features

### Integrated Translation Environment

* **Synchronized Video Player**: Load your video and see it alongside your SRT file. Clicking a subtitle in the editor jumps the video to the correct time, and the video player can be controlled with extensive keyboard shortcuts.
* **Subtitle Preview Overlay**: See how your translation will look on-screen with a live preview overlay on the video player. You can customize the font size and switch between viewing the original or the translated text.
* **Side-by-Side Editor**: A clear editor view showing the original text next to a rich-text field for your translation for each subtitle entry.
* **Real-time QA Checks**: Get instant feedback on your translations. The tool automatically checks for and flags issues related to Characters Per Second (CPS) and characters-per-line limits based on your settings.

### Computer-Assisted Translation (CAT) Tools

* **Translation Memory (TM)**: Import and export standard TMX files or create a TM from scratch. Get fuzzy match suggestions with similarity scores and a color-coded "diff" view that highlights the exact differences between the source text and the TM match.
* **Terminology (Glossary)**: Manage your project's terminology with full TBX import/export support. Terms from your glossary are automatically highlighted in the source text for easy reference.
* **Floating Panels**: The TM and Terminology tools are housed in fully draggable and resizable floating windows, allowing you to create a completely custom workspace.

### Productivity & Workflow

* **Comprehensive Shortcut System**: A massive set of keyboard shortcuts covers nearly every action: video playback, navigating between subtitles, inserting TM and glossary suggestions, and applying text formatting. The entire shortcut map can be customized, saved, and imported.
* **Find & Replace**: A powerful tool to find and replace text across all subtitles in your file, with support for case sensitivity and regular expressions.
* **Statistics Panel**: A collapsible panel keeps track of your progress, showing translated segments, word counts, and a summary of QA errors.

### Project Management & Data Safety

* **Full Project Files (.subpanda)**: Save your entire workspace—including the SRT file, TM, glossary, video reference, and settings—into a single `.subpanda` project file.
* **Automatic Backup**: Your session is automatically backed up to your browser's local storage (IndexedDB) to prevent data loss. The tool will notify you if a restorable backup is available.
* **Multilingual Interface**: The application is available in both English and Spanish.
