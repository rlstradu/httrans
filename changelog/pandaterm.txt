Key Features

### Core Glossary Management

* **Create Glossaries from Scratch**: Start a new glossary by defining the source and target languages for your project.
* **Import TBX Files**: Load existing glossaries in the standard TBX format. PandaTerm is built to be compatible with different TBX dialects (handling both `<martif>` and `<tbx>` root elements) and will auto-detect the primary languages from the file.
* **Export to TBX**: Download your complete glossary as a clean, standards-compliant TBX file, ready for use in professional CAT tools.

### Detailed Term Editing

* **Rich Term Data**: Each glossary entry can include a source term, target term, definition, notes, and part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
* **User-Friendly Editing**: Click on any term in the table to open a clear and simple modal window for editing all its details.
* **Clickable Links**: Any URLs included in the "Definition" or "Notes" fields are automatically converted into clickable links for easy access.

### Productivity & User Experience

* **Powerful Search**: Instantly filter your glossary as you type. You can scope your search to source terms only, target terms only, or all fields.
* **Undo Functionality**: Made a mistake? Easily undo your last action (add, edit, or delete) with the "Undo" button or the standard Ctrl+Z keyboard shortcut.
* **Light & Dark Themes**: Switch between a light and dark theme for your visual comfort with a single click.
* **Keyboard Navigation**: Speed up new term creation by using the Enter key to navigate through the input fields.
* **Multilingual Interface**: The PandaTerm user interface is available in both English and Spanish.
